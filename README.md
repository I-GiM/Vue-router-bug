# Vue-router-bug

#Steps to reproduce

This is a very dumbed down version of my application as i cannot bring in the repo to public but the same thing happens in my app

After cloning repo, run 'yarn install' then 'yarn serve'

On the Home page, click the 'View details' link; it will take you to the next page

Clicking any of the links does not navigate to the required destination, it returns to it's former route
